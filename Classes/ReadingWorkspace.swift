//
//  ReadingWorkspace.swift
//  PocketSword
//
//  The reading workspace.
//
//  `ReadingWorkspaceModel` is the coordinator. It owns the two `ReaderPaneModel`s
//  (Bible and commentary), the chapter-load fan-out (`displayChapter`), study-popup
//  routing, and the Focus-mode / verse-menu / bookmark-highlight state.
//  `ReadingModeSwitcher` in `PocketSwordApp.swift` renders whichever pane is active.
//
//  `ReaderPaneModel` is one reading surface: the chapter document, its
//  `ReaderChromeModel`, and the per-pane scroll/verse bookkeeping. Two exist for
//  the app's lifetime and both stay loaded, because `displayChapter` defers a
//  `refToShow` / `pendingRestore` into the pane it did not render.
//
//  Things that look odd and are deliberate:
//
//  * **The `refToShow` / `pendingRestore` deferral.** `displayChapter` renders the
//    polled pane immediately and hands the *other* pane a pending ref + restore
//    that it applies when it next becomes active. That is what lets a verse's
//    "commentary" action land on the right verse without rendering MHCC on every
//    Bible chapter change. `applyPendingWork()`'s branch order is load-bearing.
//  * **Chapter paging restores no position in either direction** — do not
//    "restore" a verse position on `previousChapter`.
//  * **`bibleScrollPosition` / `commentaryScrollPosition`** are raw `UserDefaults`
//    string keys with no `Defaults` constant, written as `"%d"` of a `CGFloat`.
//    They are persisted; `displayChapter`'s `.scroll` arm reads them back into an
//    `.offset(_:)` restore.
//  * Cross-object coordination is method calls. The few `NotificationCenter`
//    observers left exist only because something outside this file posts them.
