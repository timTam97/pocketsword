//
//  The acceptance criterion for the pure-Swift versification + reference layer: it
//  must reproduce `SwordBook` and `sword::VerseKey`'s reference semantics exactly,
//  and the `x` / `scriptRef` branches must be provably unreachable for the shipped
//  content.
//
//  === RETARGETED (SWORD_REMOVAL_PLAN.md Phase 5 step 12) ===
//
//  Phase 4 wrote this as a *differential* file: it drove the live engine and the
//  Swift table side by side. That half is now **deleted** — eleven tests plus the
//  `module(_:)` / `moduleForNavigation(_:)` helpers — because Phase 5 removes the
//  engine and a comparison against nothing is not a test.
//
//  Nothing is lost, and that is a measured claim rather than a hope.
//  `Tests/Fixtures/versification-KJV-oracle.txt` was captured from the live engine
//  in Phase 4 and holds **66 books x 5 members, all 1,189 verse maxima, and all
//  2,376 transitions** — i.e. a superset of what the deleted comparisons checked.
//  `testAllTransitionsMatchTheCommittedFixture` reads all of it, so the gate is the
//  same gate with a recorded oracle instead of a live one. Do NOT recapture that
//  fixture to make a red test pass.
//
//  The two deletions that are NOT covered by the fixture, and why that is right:
//   * `testBoundariesClampInSwordAndReturnNilInSwift` asserted the deliberate
//     difference at Genesis 1 / Revelation 22 (VerseKey clamps, Swift returns nil).
//     The Swift half of that claim is what matters and is still asserted by
//     `testAllTransitionsMatchTheCommittedFixture`, whose fixture records `<nil>`
//     at both boundaries.
//   * `testTranslateBookNameIsIdentityForAll66` proved a SWORD round-trip was the
//     identity for all 66 books. Phase 4 already removed both of its production
//     callers on the strength of that proof; with the engine gone there is no
//     round-trip left to be non-identity.
//
//  === Two tiers ===
//
//  * FAST — runs on every `test` invocation. All 2,376 next/prev transitions plus
//    66 books x 5 members and 1,189 maxima against the committed fixture, the
//    parser grammar fixture, `displayRef` munging, and the four-part
//    unreachability proof (re-derived from the store, not trusted as prose).
//  * EXHAUSTIVE — set `PSREF_EXHAUSTIVE=1`. All 31,102 parser round-trips, 1,189
//    parser-vs-resolver agreement checks. (The two engine-driven exhaustive tests —
//    `displayRef` vs a live VerseKey, and the `builtin_abbrevs` inclusion
//    direction — went with the engine.)
//
//  Both tiers print their coverage: a silently-sampled gate reads as "covered
//  everything" when it did not.
