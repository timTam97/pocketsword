## Project

PocketSword is a GPL'd iOS Bible-study app, forked from `bitbucket.org/niccarter/pocketsword`. It ships CrossWire SWORD module *content* baked into a bundled SQLite store; there is no SWORD engine, C++ or Objective-C at runtime.

- **Pure Swift.** `Classes/` is Swift files plus one header, `globals.h` (enums + constants, imported by both bridging headers). No vendored code, no CocoaPods/SPM.
- **SwiftUI UI.** `@main PocketSwordApp` with a four-workspace `TabView` (Read / Search / Library / Settings). No XIBs; only `LaunchScreen.storyboard`. No WebKit: the reader is a native `ScrollView` + `LazyVStack` over `AttributedString`. UIKit survives only as leaf values plus a `@UIApplicationDelegateAdaptor` for `BGTaskScheduler` registration and the orientation hook.
- Old implementations (SWORD engine, Obj-C++ bridge, `tools/swordbake`, WebView reader) are in git history at `fa09511^`. Do not resurrect them.

## Build / run

- Open `PocketSword.xcodeproj` and build the shared `PocketSword` scheme (a second scheme `PocketSword1` exists). No workspace, no package step.
- CLI: `xcodebuild -project PocketSword.xcodeproj -scheme PocketSword -configuration Debug -sdk iphonesimulator build`, with `CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO` if there is no dev team. **Stable `/usr/bin/xcodebuild` fails this iOS 27 project with "Found no destinations"** — use `DEVELOPER_DIR=/Applications/Xcode-beta.app/Contents/Developer /Applications/Xcode-beta.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin/xcodebuild`, or the Xcode MCP build/test tools.
- A clean build should show **`CompileC` 0**. Any `CompileC` means non-Swift sources came back into the target — a regression.
- Configurations `Debug` / `Release` / `Distribution` have **different** bundle IDs (`org.timsams.PocketSword` / `org.timsam.PocketSword` / `org.Crosswire.PocketSword`).
- `IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET = 27.0` on all 4 targets × 3 configs; universal. `SWIFT_VERSION = 5.0`, `SWIFT_STRICT_CONCURRENCY = minimal`. No prefix header.
- zlib comes from the SDK's Clang module (`import zlib` in `PSContentStore`); no build setting needed.

## Tests

Two bundles:

- **`PocketSwordTests`** (app-hosted, `@testable import PocketSword`), sources in `Classes/*Tests.swift`. Expected result: **0 failures, 3 skipped** (151 tests at last count). The 3 skips are env-gated: two `PSREF_EXHAUSTIVE` tests and `PSDOC_EXHAUSTIVE`'s `testNativeDocumentMatchesHTMLForEveryChapter` (all 1,189 chapters × 2 modules × 2 option endpoints, ~30 s — run it when touching either chapter emitter).
- **`PocketSwordUITests`** (`Tests/PocketSwordUITests.swift`): 12 XCUITests over the four workspaces.

Rules:

- **Fixtures in `Tests/Fixtures/` were captured from the live SWORD engine, which is gone.** They cannot be regenerated. A red fixture test is a real behaviour change — fix the code, never recapture or "fix" the test. Key fixtures: chapter bodies at both option endpoints, lexicon entries, `versification-KJV-oracle.txt` (the whole versification gate), `search-index-KJV.digest` (all 31,102 FTS rows, hashed), `chapter-loop-counters.tsv` (`entryCount` per chapter). `strongsPad-prefixed-key-bug.txt` is a historical record, not an oracle.
- **`PersistedFormatTests` locks byte-exact persisted formats** (history / bookmark / search-history serialization, the per-module pref-key format), quirks included. A red test there means you will corrupt user data.
- **`PSSearchIndexParityTests`** runs a real index build (tens of seconds) and compares every row against the digest. It stays in the default suite because the failure it guards is silent: search results just go missing.
- **Check the skip count, not just the pass count.** The two lexicon XCUITests (`testStrongsLinkOpensItsLexiconEntry`, `testLexiconCrossLinkNavigatesWithinThePopup`) `XCTSkip` when Strong's markers are off — the state of a freshly erased simulator — and report green having asserted nothing. Turn the pref on by editing the app container plist directly: `plutil -replace strongsPreference_KJV -bool YES <container>/Library/Preferences/org.timsams.PocketSword.plist` (`simctl spawn defaults write` does not take). On an already-launched container, also flush the simulator's `cfprefsd` or the app gets the cached value: `xcrun simctl spawn <device> launchctl kill SIGKILL system/com.apple.cfprefsd.xpc.daemon`. Cheap sanity check: seed `fontSizePreference` to 30 and confirm the text visibly changes.
- **Env vars in a test run** need a temporary `<EnvironmentVariables>` block in the shared scheme's `TestAction` **plus** `shouldUseLaunchSchemeArgsEnv = "NO"`. The scheme is checked in — back it up and restore it. `RunAllTests` / `RunSomeTests` have no env parameter.
- From the CLI, `-destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,id=<UUID>'` works where `name=...` may not.
- **If every XCUITest fails in `setUp` with "Timed out while evaluating UI query", or Xcode says it `Could not attach to pid`, the harness is wedged, not your change.** A crashed Xcode leaves a `testmanagerd` inside the simulator runtime holding the debug slot. `kill -9` the one whose path contains `…SimulatorRuntime…/RuntimeRoot/usr/libexec/testmanagerd` (not the host's `/usr/libexec/testmanagerd`) and reboot the device. Confirm attribution by stashing your change and re-running.

## Driving the app on the simulator (Xcode MCP)

- Session: `DeviceInteractionStartWorkspaceSession` → `DeviceInteractionInstallAndRun` → `DeviceInteractionSynthesize` (repeat) → `DeviceInteractionEndSession`. Use the *Workspace* variant (the plain one cannot install). Always end the session.
- Every Xcode MCP call needs `tabIdentifier` (`windowtab1` here).
- `interactionCommand` syntax is in the `device-interaction` skill (`~/.claude/skills/device-interaction/`; re-export with `xcrun agent skills export <dir>`). Common: `t <x> <y>` tap, `d <x> <y>` double tap, `t <x1> <y1> f <x2> <y2>` swipe, `w <dur>` wait, `b h` home, `sender keyboard kbd <text>` (must be last; `\u{000A}` is Return). Omit the command to just capture state.
- **Use the hierarchy file for coordinates**, not the screenshot: each element has a `hitPoint`. Every verse is a `StaticText` and every Strong's / morph / footnote / verse-menu target is a `Link` whose identifier is its `pslink://` URL (e.g. `pslink://strongs/Hebrew/0430`).
- The reader `ScrollView` has identifier `reading.chapter-content`. **Both panes carry it** (the inactive one sits at `opacity(0)`), so XCUITests must use `.firstMatch`.
- SwiftUI identifiers must be checked against a real dump: `Tab`'s `accessibilityIdentifier` never reaches the tab-bar button (match tabs by label), and a menu row exposes its label, not its identifier.
- The app restores its last tab and scroll position; capture before assuming where it starts.
- Sheets animate in: `w 2.0` before capturing.
- Per-run env vars for an **app** run: `InstallAndRun`'s `environmentVariables` / `commandLineArguments` (`$(inherited)` keeps the scheme's own).
- `xcrun simctl terminate` / `launch` / `openurl` work (`openurl` is how to drive `sword://`), but can fight the MCP session: after a `terminate` the next `Synthesize` may report `Crashed` when nothing crashed — check for an `.ips` report before believing it, then `InstallAndRun` to re-attach. Driving `simctl` while a session is attached can take Xcode down. A reinstall assigns a new container UUID; re-resolve with `xcrun simctl get_app_container <device> <bundle-id> data`.
- Harmless console noise: `UIAccessibilityLoaderWebShared` duplicate-class warning, `cannot add handler to 0 from 0`.

## The baked content store

`Resources/PSContent.sqlite` + `Resources/Versification-KJV.json` are the app's content and versification. **The converter that produced them is gone; they cannot be regenerated in this repo.** Both are bundled by path.

- Store is **schemaVersion 2 / tokenGrammar v2**; `PSContentStore` refuses anything else. A mismatch would address the wrong chunk slot and return *plausible but wrong* text.
- The FTS source text (`plain_texts`) is shipped, not derived on device — a second derivation would be an untested reimplementation whose bugs silently drop search results.
- **Exactly five modules, no UI to add/remove/pick:** KJV (Bible), MHCC (commentary), and three fixed-role lexicons — `StrongsRealGreek` (`GreekDef`), `StrongsRealHebrew` (`HebrewDef`), `Robinson` (`GreekParse`). The `BundledModules` enum in `AppConstants.swift` is the source of truth. Nothing is unpacked; `Documents/` is empty on a fresh install.

## Architecture

### Launch

1. `@main PocketSwordApp` declares a `WindowGroup` around `RootView` and holds the app delegate via `@UIApplicationDelegateAdaptor`.
2. `PocketSwordAppDelegate` does only what UIKit owns: `BGTaskScheduler` registration (**must** complete before `didFinishLaunching` returns), `HistoryStore.startCloudSync()`, `AppSession.start()`, and a scene delegate supplying `supportedInterfaceOrientations(for:)` for the rotation-lock pref.
3. `RootView`'s `.task` runs `LaunchCoordinator.prepare()` off the main actor and moves `LaunchPhase` `.preparing → .ready` (or `.failed`). On `.ready` it calls `ReadingWorkspaceModel.start()` and replays any held `sword://` URL.

**Order in step 3 is load-bearing.** Nothing may touch `PSModuleController`, the store or the reader until `prepare()` returns, because its one-shot migrations (`DefaultsLastRefValidated` in particular) can rewrite `lastRef`. That is why `AppSession` parks an incoming URL in `pendingURL`.

`LaunchCoordinator` runs `resetPreferences`, the insomnia pref, `MMM` temp cleanup, and five one-shot migrations: `DefaultsModuleChoiceRetired`, `DefaultsGlobalFontOnly`, `DefaultsLastRefValidated`, `DefaultsDictKeyCaseFixed`, `DefaultsSwordRetired`.

- `DefaultsSwordRetired` deletes the old engine's `Documents/{mods.d,modules,locales.d,unused}` and `<Caches>/InstallMgr` on upgrade. `PSBookmarks.plist` sits at `Documents/` root, outside those — **never widen the sweep to `Documents/` itself**.
- `resetPreferences()` re-resolves the reading primaries (`reloadLastBible()` / `reloadLastCommentary()`) after `resetModuleSelections()`; the lexicon is left nil deliberately. `AppSession.observeAppStateReset()` reloads the models on `.appStateDidReset`; it must go through `SettingsModel.reload()` (its `isReloading` flag suppresses `didSet` writes that would re-create the deleted keys) and be registered `queue: .main` (the reset runs off the main actor).
- Known, deliberate asymmetries: the reset removes local `bibleHistory` but not the iCloud copy, and the key list is the legacy one, so rotation lock, fullscreen mode, the three `lastSearch*`, scroll positions and verse positions survive a reset.

### Workspaces

`Read` / `Search` / `Library` / `Settings` in `WorkspaceTabs`. Display order is Read, Library, Settings, Search (`TabRole.search` moves Search to the trailing slot).

**SwiftUI modifiers in the wrong place fail silently** — no warning, no crash, no unit-test failure. Drive the simulator and check the hierarchy. Known traps:

- `tabViewBottomAccessory` is one accessory for the whole `TabView`, not per tab.
- There is no usable `.bottomBar` on iOS 27; items land on top of the floating tab bar.
- `toolbarVisibility(_:for: .tabBar)` must be applied to content **inside** a tab (Focus mode does it from `ReaderScreen`'s `NavigationStack`); on the `TabView` it does nothing.
- A `safeAreaInset(edge: .top)` bar does not combine with a large navigation title — the large-title region expands behind it. `SearchView` and `DictionaryView` pin `.inline` for this reason.
- **Workspaces are persistent.** `SearchView.configure` runs once per launch, so anything seeding a workspace from outside must drive its model directly (`SearchModel.startStrongsQuery`), and must not assume anything `configure` computes (e.g. `strongsAvailable`) has been computed — both `startStrongsQuery` and `optionsDidChange` gate on `module != nil`.

### Reading coordinator (`ReadingWorkspace.swift`)

- `ReadingWorkspaceModel` owns the two `ReaderPaneModel`s (Bible and commentary), the `displayChapter` fan-out, study-popup routing, and Focus mode. Cross-object coordination is method calls; the few remaining `NotificationCenter` observers exist only because something outside the reader posts them.
- **Both panes stay in the hierarchy** (inactive at `opacity(0)`). `displayChapter` renders the polled pane and defers `refToShow` / `pendingRestore` into the other; that deferral is what avoids rendering MHCC on every Bible chapter change. **`mode`'s `didSet` is the only drain**, so a font change (`redisplayWithDefaults()`) polls the **active** pane.
- `ReaderPaneModel.render` writes `lastRef` (toolbar title and relaunch restore both read it).
- Links arrive as `pslink://` URLs through the reader's `OpenURLAction` and open a `StudyPopupSheet`.
- **Chapter paging restores no position, in both directions.** `previousChapter()` / `nextChapter()` go through `page(forward:)` with `.none`. The verse-position defaults hold the verse in the chapter being *left*, so restoring them on paging lands on a wrong verse. Don't reintroduce a restore. The only entry point is the chevron toolbar buttons.

### Content reader (render path)

**The app reads only from the baked store; there is no fallback.** Failures are split into **fatal** (store missing, schema/grammar mismatch, missing chunk sizes, bad versification — a crash beats a blank app) and **loud-and-nil** (one bad chapter must not brick the app). `PSContentReader.swift`'s header lists which is which; keep it accurate.

- `PSContentStore` — read-only SQLite + chunk framing, serial queue, zlib `uncompress()` (not `Compression.framework`; blobs are zlib-with-header with exact `raw_size`). Reads chunk sizes from `content_meta`.
- `PSChapterExpander` — tokens → the exact HTML the SWORD markup filters emitted. A disabled toggle **skips** its token. `Options.forHeading`: a title token is headings-gated in a chapter record but unconditional inside a stored heading.
- `PSChapterAssembler` — the chapter accumulator loop, quirks included. Its `entryCount` is **not** a verse count (it advances for skipped entries) and is pinned by `chapter-loop-counters.tsv`. Verse highlighting inserts at UTF-16 offsets over `NSMutableString`; redoing it over `String.Index` is a different algorithm.
- `PSBookOSISResolver` — book name → OSIS abbreviation, and the whole versification layer (`book(at:)`, `verseMax`, `nextChapter` / `previousChapter`, `displayRef`). next/prev return **nil** at Genesis 1 / Revelation 22 (not clamped — a clamped ref would turn a no-op into a full re-render). `displayRef` returns the un-munged `longName` form that call sites munge downstream.
- `PSRefParser` — free-text refs, `<book> [<chapter>[:<verse>[-<verse>]]]`, single book, deliberately narrow (header documents each omission). Its one production caller is inbound `sword://`. It is **wider** than `PSBookOSISResolver.resolve(ref:)`, so anything persisting a parsed ref must check the resolver accepts it (see `AppSession.open(_:)`).
- `PSRefLinkRouter` — pure `showRef` routing predicate; an unrecognised module type defaults to bible.
- `PSContentReader` — module selection, per-module option prefs, bookmark-highlight lookup. `chapterDocument(module:ref:kind:)` is **the render path**. `chapterBody(...)` returns engine-exact HTML and is kept as a **test oracle** — `PSChapterDocumentParityTests` proves the native document matches it.

### Native reader (`PSChapterDocument.swift`, `SwiftUINativeReader.swift`, `PSEntryDocument.swift`)

- **Two emitters over the same tokens, deliberately.** `PSChapterExpander` → HTML; `PSChapterDocumentBuilder` → `ChapterDocument`. Their independence is what makes the parity test meaningful — **do not make one call the other.** The chapter corpus is a closed set of six inline tags, which is why there is no HTML parser dependency.
- **Lexicon entries and footnotes have their own renderer** (`PSEntryDocument.swift`) with a wider vocabulary (`br`, `a name=` / `a href=`, `sup`/`sub`, `q`, `bib`).
  - Hebrew and Greek Strong's entries shape their key-anchor preamble differently. The "swallow the `<br />` after the key anchor" rule means *immediately* after; `testGreekLexiconKeepsItsLemmaLineBreak` pins it.
  - A link's run range is bounded at the anchor's **open** (`runs.count`), and re-applied at a `<br />` block boundary. `testEveryLexiconCrossLinkIsBoundToItsOwnAnchorText` and the synthetic `testCrossLinkSpanningALineBreakKeepsBothHalves` pin it.
  - An `OpenURLAction` that returns `.handled` with no handler swallows the tap. Claim `.handled` only when there is a handler; otherwise `.systemAction`.
  - Cross-links resolve in place in `StudyPopupSheet` (a `trail` + Back), not by stacking sheets. The `G`/`H` prefix comes from the **target** module (317 links go Greek → Hebrew).
- **Scroll position is identity**, via `ScrollPosition(id:)`. In prose mode rows are paragraphs, so `scrollToVerse` lands at the top of the verse's paragraph (`rowID(containing:)`).
  - Applying a scroll in the same update as a document change does nothing; `apply(_:)` defers by one update. `restoreAfterSizeChange` inlines its own copy of `apply`'s `.verse` body so the rotation suppression clears in the same hop — don't de-duplicate them.
  - **`ScrollPosition.scrollTo(y:)` is inset-relative**, and the persisted offset (`contentOffset.y + contentInsets.top`) matches it on purpose. This is measured, not a bug. At rest the sum is 0.
  - Launch offset restore: the reader's size settles in steps during launch, so the rotation hook fires; `restoreAfterSizeChange` prefers an outstanding offset restore. The first geometry publish is an unlaid-out scroll view and must not be persisted. `ReaderScrollSample` + `outstandingOffsetRestore` give `scrollOffsetChanged` a three-way gate (drop unlaid-out samples; clear on landing within 2 pt; give up at `maxOffset` when unreachable), released by `userBeganScrolling()`. Pinned by `testUnlaidOutGeometryDoesNotOverwriteThePersistedScrollOffset` and `testUnreachableOffsetRestoreGivesUpAtTheScrollViewsMaximum`.
  - Known residual: ~1 launch in 4 the toolbar title keeps `…:1` after a correct restore; self-corrects on first scroll. Don't assert on the nav-bar title in XCUITests here — assert on reader content.
  - The prose row set is cached on `ReaderPaneModel.paragraphs` (invalidated by `document`'s `didSet`). Never call `ChapterDocument.paragraphs` from a view body. The cache is on the model, not the value type, to keep `ChapterDocument`'s synthesized `Equatable` and memberwise init that the parity tests use.
- **Verse layout honours verse-per-line.** VPL off (default): prose, breaking at the KJV's pilcrows (all at verse starts). VPL on: one row per verse. A commentary always breaks per verse (MHCC has no pilcrows).

### Dictionary

- `dict_keys.key` is `COLLATE NOCASE` as defence in depth; both producers return the module's true key casing, and `PSContentStoreTests` asserts both casings resolve for all 15,824 keys. `DefaultsDictKeyCaseFixed` sweeps `<Caches>/cache-*` key caches by prefix.
- Rows iterate `LibraryModel.visibleDictionaryKeys` and are `NavigationLink(value: key)` + `.navigationDestination(for: String.self)`. Keep the value form: the `NavigationLink { destination } label:` form evaluates the destination (a lookup + inflate + expand) for every realized row.

### Search (`PSSearchEngine.swift`, `PSSearchQuery.swift`)

Each of these fails **silently** if "simplified":

1. `SQLITE_TRANSIENT` on every `sqlite3_bind_text`; SQL passed to `prepare_v2` / `exec` via `withCString`. Otherwise every query matches nothing.
2. `SQLITE_OPEN_FULLMUTEX` + `sqlite3_busy_timeout(2000)` and **no** serial queue, so a ~30 s build doesn't block every keystroke's query.
3. The FTS5 schema, its seven columns and their order, and `ORDER BY rowid` are fixed.
4. `PSSearchQuery.cleanDisplayText` runs **before** the emptiness test in the build loop, so it decides which rows exist.
5. The index is `<Caches>/search/<module>.db` (`AppPaths.searchIndexPath(for:)`), shared directory — **`dropIndex` must not remove the directory.** A cached engine whose file is gone reopens on demand.

`cleanDisplayText` (strips inline `<H0430>` markers) and `foldForIndex` (diacritic fold for `text_norm`) are pinned to known vectors in `PSSearchIndexParityTests`; changing either stops queries matching indexes already built on devices. Bump `PSSearchEngine.schemaVersion` to force a rebuild. `engine(forModuleName:)` returns a shared instance. Cancellation belongs to `SearchIndexCoordinator`.

### Module controller

`PSModuleController` (singleton, `defaultModuleController`) holds the primary Bible / commentary / dictionary as **`String?` names** (`primaryBibleName` etc.) plus ref-string helpers. `nil` means not yet resolved.

### Display preferences

The split by scope is load-bearing:

- **Per-module content toggles** (Strong's, morph, headings, footnotes, cross-refs, red-letter, verse-per-line) live in the reader's `ToolbarOverflowMenu`, built by `ReaderDisplayToggle.toggles(forModule:store:)`. Keys are `"<pref>_<ModuleName>"`, gated on the baked feature set (`content_meta` `module.<name>.features`, via `PSContentStore.moduleHasFeature`).
  - **KJV shows exactly six rows**: Strong's, Morph, Headings, Footnotes, Red Letter, Verse Per Line. **No cross-references** — KJV has no scripref feature. Don't "fix" this.
  - **MHCC has no rows**; the section is omitted. Both asserted by `AppStateStoresTests.testDisplayTogglesMatchBakedFeatureSets`.
- **Global**: font name + size and device options, in `SettingsView` (`SwiftUISupportingViews.swift`). **One font for the whole app**: `ChapterTextRenderer.Style.current()` reads only unsuffixed `fontNamePreference` / `fontSizePreference`.
- `EntryTextView` honours the same keys, with a legibility floor `EntryTextView.minimumBodySize` (14). The Strong's arm uses the system face (`usesSystemFace`). `AppConstants.defaultFontSize` (12) is the single absent-key fallback (Swift-only; `globals.h` has no counterpart).

### Constants: `globals.h` ↔ `AppConstants.swift`

**Dual-maintained.** `globals.h` is the source of truth for `Defaults*` keys, notification names, `ShownTab`, `PSSearch*`, `ModuleType`, `ATTRTYPE_*`, `SW_OUTPUT_*_KEY`, `SWMOD_*`. `AppConstants.swift` mirrors every wire string **byte-for-byte**. The persisted key often differs from the macro name (`DefaultsLastRef` → `"lastRef"`). Change one, change the other, or persisted data breaks.

- Retired keys (`DefaultsKJVRemoved`, `DefaultsMHCCRemoved`, `DefaultsStrongsGreekModule`, `DefaultsStrongsHebrewModule`, `DefaultsMorphGreekModule`) stay declared so the names aren't reused; `DefaultsModuleChoiceRetired` clears them.
- `ShownTab` ordinals may be persisted — do not renumber or delete. New code uses `ReadingMode` / `Workspace`.
- `PocketSword-Swift.h` is not generated. `@objc` annotations on model types are inert; don't read one as evidence of an Obj-C caller. `NSObject` subclassing on persisted model types is relied on by the byte-locked formats.

### Persistence

- `UserDefaults` with keys from `globals.h` / `AppConstants.swift`; per-module prefs are `"<PrefName>_<ModuleName>"` via the `UserDefaults.ps*(…forModule:)` extension.
- Reading history (`bibleHistory`) syncs through `NSUbiquitousKeyValueStore`; `HistoryStore` owns observer, merge/dedup/cap, write-back and `addEntry(mode:)` (the byte-locked `[ref, "0", mod, NSDate]` row). `addEntry` reads `lastRef` from its own injected `defaults`.
- Bookmarks: `Documents/PSBookmarks.plist` at the **root** of `Documents/` (see `DefaultsSwordRetired`).
- Derived data lives in Caches: search indexes and lexicon key caches.
- `bibleScrollPosition` / `commentaryScrollPosition` are raw `UserDefaults` string keys, written as `"%d"` of a `CGFloat`.

### URL handling

`sword://` is registered in `misc/Info.plist`. URLs arrive via `onOpenURL` → `AppSession.open(_:)`; before launch prep finishes they are held in `pendingURL`.

| URL | resolves to |
|---|---|
| `sword://Bible/John%203:16` | John 3:16 |
| `sword://KJV/Romans%208:28` | Romans 8:28 (module name as host) |
| `sword://Bible/Jude` | Jude 1:1 |
| `sword://Bible/Genesis%201:1.` | Genesis 1:1 (trailing period tolerated) |

An unresolvable ref is ignored (no navigation, no history, one `alog` line).

## Localization

English only. Strings go through `NSLocalizedString` against `en.lproj/Localizable.strings` (source of truth for keys) and `Settings.bundle/en.lproj/Root.strings`. `knownRegions` lists only `en`; don't add locales without a deliberate decision.
